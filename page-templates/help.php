<h2>Using the Application</h2>

<p>Utterfare&copy; is a food search engine unlike anything that has been developed before. To receive the best experience the user should allow Utterfare&copy; to access their location while using the app. Once Utterfare&copy; has the user's location it can then successfully provide accurate search results as well as nearby top and local picks based on the user's location and preferences.</p>

<h2>Deleting Your Account</h2>
<p>If you would like to remove your account after creation, simply email <a href="mailto:customerservice@utterfare.com">customerservice@utterfare.com</a> and request your account be removed. Your account and all associated data will be removed promptly and you will receive a notification confirming the same. Our user's privacy is of the highest importance to us. We will always respect that and will never sell or transfer your personal information to any other company, person, or organization without your permission first.</p>
