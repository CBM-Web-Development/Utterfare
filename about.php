			<p>Utterfare was born out of a shared frustration between a father and son. Both were in a city they were unfamiliar with and neither of them knew where to go eat. Conventional searches were not helpful because nothing showed them quite what they were looking for. Now, Utterfare is here to help do away with the problem of not knowing exactly who serves what. Gone are they days where you don’t know who serves the best duck confit, vegan BBQ tofu burgers, or any other food you would like to eat. With Utterfare you no longer have to fumble through a multitude of web pages just to view large menus that probably don’t have what you are looking for. Utterfare allows you to search for specific menu items and displays everything that is a close or exact match to you search within the radius you select. Each item even comes with it’s own picture, detailed description, and restaurant information! Use Utterfare online by going to www.utterfare.com on your computer, tablet, or smartphone, or  download the app in the app store. Happy searching and bon appétit!</p>
